# My-Chat-App
A Side Project involving the creation of a simple chat app using Node, Express and Mongo DB.


This real-time chat application allows multiple users to enter a room and have a conversation!

Chat-Time was build using the power of Node JS and Websockets, which allowed the use of extensive Event Handlers to establish strong endpoints for
effective communication.
