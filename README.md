# Chat-Time.
A Side Project involving the creation of a simple chat app using Node, Express and Mongo DB.


This real-time chat application allows multiple users to enter a room and have a conversation!

Chat-Time was build using the power of Node JS and Websockets, which allowed the use of extensive Event Handlers to establish strong endpoints for
effective communication. 

The interface of this application was developed using HTML,CSS and Express along with JS to implement the added functionality of dynamic and responsive webpages. 

The core of this project is handled by MongoDB which was accessed with the help of Mongoose with the aim of storing user credentials in the database. This also helped develop a Log-In feature to the application, thereby providing added functionality.

In addition to these features, security is also implemented using the concepts of OAuth and every user's password is hashed using 8 rounds to provide extra security, thereby preventing a direct loss of any user's credentials during a potential breach of the database.
